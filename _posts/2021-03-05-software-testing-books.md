## 1. SoapUI Cookbook by Rupert Anderson

### Description

Packed with practical guidance, this book will show you how to build core SoapUI skills, integrate open source libraries, and code the extra functionality needed to quickly overcome common and advanced API test problems.

Building up your skills, you will progress to more advanced topics such as Groovy scripting, testing secured services, load test concurrency issues, using plugins and developing your own!

So when out-of-the-box SoapUI can't do exactly what you need or the quick guidance you require just isn't there, then take, tweak, and use what you need from a broad range of practical examples in this book and customize your way to API testing success with coverage of SOAP, REST, and Groovy.

## 2. Mastering Selenium Testing Tools by Thomas Sundberg, Ripon Al Wasim

### Description

Test the look, feel, and performance of web applications across different web browsers using Selenium for a flawless user experience.

## 10. Testing Code Security by Maura A. van der Linden

### Description

The huge proliferation of security vulnerability exploits, worms, and viruses place an incredible drain on both cost and confidence for manufacturers and consumers. The release of trustworthy code requires a specific set of skills and techniques, but this information is often dispersed and decentralized, encrypted in its own jargon and terminology, and can take a colossal amount of time and data mining to find. Written in simple, common terms, Testing Code Security is a consolidated resource designed to teach beginning and intermediate testers the software security concepts needed to conduct relevant and effective tests. Answering the questions pertinent to all testing procedures, the book considers the differences in process between security testing and functional testing, the creation of a security test plan, the benefits and pitfalls of threat-modeling, and the identification of root vulnerability problems and how to test for them. The book begins with coverage of foundation concepts, the process of security test planning, and the test pass. Offering real life examples, it presents various vulnerabilities and attacks and explains the testing techniques appropriate for each. It concludes with a collection of background overviews on related topics to fill common knowledge gaps. Filled with cases illustrating the most common classes of security vulnerabilities, the book is written for all testers working in any environment, and it gives extra insight to threats particular to Microsoft Windows® platforms. Providing a practical guide on how to carry out the task of security software testing, Testing Code Security gives the reader the knowledge needed to begin testing software security for any project and become an integral part in the drive to produce better software security and safety.

## 12. Learning Python Testing by Daniel Arbuckle

### Description

Automated testing is the best way to increase efficiency and decrease the defects of software testing. It takes away much of the effort on your part so that you can find bugs early and easily. The Python unit testing framework makes it easy to write efficient automated test cases in Python. Applications involving many paradigms and styles can be very complicated to test, but with the right tools, testing becomes the simplest part of the development process.

This book starts with a short introduction to testing, and then introduces the doctest tool, both in terms of practicalities and how it fits into the testing environment. From there, the discussion proceeds to unittest.mock and mock objects, and to unittest. Next, Nose is introduced and discussed. Later on, focus turns from the tools themselves toward best practices and disciplines of testing. Finally, the integration of testing with existing build processes and toolchains is covered. By the end of this book, you will know how to use automated testing quickly and easily and in a way that helps catch bugs early and fix them.
