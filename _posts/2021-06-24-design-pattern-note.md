## Design patterns
* Are about dependencies and abstractions
* Are about intent
* Are not limited to OO programming
* Are not limited to dynamic polymorphism
* Are not outdated nor obsolete
* Are everywhere

## Reference
* [Klaus Iglberger - Design Patterns - Facts and Misconceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5EAJTHPJN8)
