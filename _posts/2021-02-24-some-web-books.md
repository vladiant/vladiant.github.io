## Intro from 2017

Continuous education is the same or even more important thing for developer than continuous integration. Any serious developer should read at least one book every half a year if he wants to survive in industry. As it was said in Alice in Wonderland: "Here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.”

## 1. Learning ECMAScript 6 by Narayan Prusty

### Description

ECMAScript 6 is the new edition to the ECMAScript language, whose specifications are inherited by JavaScript. ES6 gives a vast makeover to JavaScript by adding new syntaxes and APIs to write complex applications and libraries that are easier to debug and maintain. ES6 aims to keep JavaScript accessible for casual developers, even after adding so many new features.
This book will provide step-by-step instructions on how to apply ES6 features instead of old JavaScript hacks and methods. Moving on, the book will teach how to use Reflect API to inspect and manipulate object properties. Next, it teaches how to create proxies, and use it to intercept and customize operations performed on objects.
Finally, it explains old modular programming techniques such as IIFE, CommonJS, AMD, and UMD and also compares it with ES6 modules and how ES6 modules can increase the performance of websites when used..

## 2. Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node by Simon Holmes

### Description

Getting MEAN teaches you how to develop web applications using the MEAN stack. First, you’ll create the skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and then push it up to a live web server. Next, add a MongoDB database and build an API before using Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser. Finally you’ll add an authentication system to the application, using the whole stack. When you finish, you’ll have all the skills you need to build a dynamic data-driven web application.

## 5. jQuery Essentials by Troy Miles

### Description

JQuery is still the most popular JavaScript library. It is used in over 60% of the top websites on the Internet. It was written to make DOM manipulation (so, moving things around a web page) easier for developers. It acts through JavaScript to ascribe HTML elements to the DOM attributes. Because it is a library of predefined functions, all you need to start using jQuery is a working knowledge of the syntax and a reference for the functions available to you.
