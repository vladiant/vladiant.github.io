## TODO
[ ] Try creating an `_include` file that inserts Google Analytics tracking code into your <head> so you can get stats on the visitors to your website. Here's an [example](https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/_includes/analytics.html).
  
[ ] For commenting for your blog Create a [DISQUS](https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/_includes/disqus.html) `include` and [call it in your `post.html` layout](https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/post.html).

[ ] Create a `sitemap.xml` file for better SEO. [You can have one automatically generated by GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages). See [this one](https://github.com/jmcglone/jmcglone.github.io/blob/master/sitemap.xml).

[ ] Check out how [the sites from the developers of Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/sites/) are setup or browse this [huge list of sites using Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites).
