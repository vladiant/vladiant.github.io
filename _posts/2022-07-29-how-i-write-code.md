## Guidelines
* Use case first
* Look for similar problems
* Direct expression of solution to this exact problem
  * Solution should do one thing
  * Never solve a problem you do not have
* How does this generalize?
* What abstraction am I trying to provide?

## FLUID:
* Functional
* Loose
* Unit testable
* Introspective
* Dempotent

## LIQUID (Bad)
* Large (files, classes and methods)
* Interdependencies
* Quagmire
* Undocumented
* Illegible
* Duplicate code

## PLASMA
* Persistence
* Local Reasoning
* Algorithms
* Simplicity
* Modularity
* Abstractions
