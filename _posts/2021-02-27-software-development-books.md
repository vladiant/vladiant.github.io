## 1. Software Systems Architecture: Working with Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives, Second Edition by Nick Rozanski

### Description

Software Systems Architecture, Second Edition is a highly regarded, practitioner-oriented guide to designing and implementing effective architectures for information systems. It is both a readily accessible introduction to software architecture and an invaluable handbook of well-established best practices.

## 2. Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition by Rick Kazman, Paul Clements, Len Bass

### Description

The award-winning and highly influential Software Architecture in Practice, Third Edition, has been substantially revised to reflect the latest developments in the field. In a real-world setting, the book once again introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture—how a software system is structured and how that system’s elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization’s business strategy.

## 3. Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 1, A System of Patterns by Michael Stal, Peter Sommerlad, Hans Rohnert, Regine Meunier, Frank Buschmann

### Description

Pattern - Oriented Software Architecture A System of Patterns Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert, Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal of Siemens AG, Germany Pattern-oriented software architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms.

## 4. Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 2, Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects by Frank Buschmann, Hans Rohnert, Michael Stal, Douglas C. Schmidt

### Description

Designing application and middleware software to run in concurrent and networked environments is a significant challenge to software developers. The patterns catalogued in this second volume of Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures (POSA) form the basis of a pattern language that addresses issues associated with concurrency and networking.

## 5. Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 3: Patterns for Resource Management by Prashant Jain, Michael Kircher

### Description

The first volume of the POSA pattern series introduced a broad-spectrum of general-purpose patterns in software design and architecture. The second narrowed the focus to fundamental patterns for building sophisticated concurrent and networked software systems and applications. This volume uses design patterns to present techniques for implementing effective resource management in a system.

## 6. Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing, 4th Volume by Douglas C. Schmidt, Kevlin Henney, Frank Buschmann

### Description

The eagerly awaited Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture (POSA) Volume 4 is about a pattern language for distributed computing.
The authors will guide you through the best practices and introduce you to key areas of building distributed software systems. POSA 4 connects many stand-alone patterns, pattern collections and pattern languages from the existing body of literature found in the POSA series. Such patterns relate to and are useful for distributed computing to a single language.

## 7. Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

### Description

Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

## 8. The Phoenix Project by George Spafford, Kevin Behr, Gene Kim

#### Description

A novel about IT, DevOps, and helping your business win. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again.

## 9. Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation, Video Enhanced Edition by Jez Humble, David Farley

### Description

Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance.

## 10. DevOps for Developers by Michael Hüttermann

### Description

DevOps for Developers delivers a practical, thorough introduction to approaches, processes and tools to foster collaboration between software development and operations. Efforts of Agile software development often end at the transition phase from development to operations. This book covers the delivery of software, this means "the last mile", with lean practices for shipping the software to production and making it available to the end users, together with the integration of operations with earlier project phases (elaboration, construction, transition).

## 11. Building Microservices by Sam Newman

### Description

Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures.

## 12. Scala for the Impatient by Cay S. Horstmann

### Description

Scala for the Impatient concisely shows developers what Scala can do and how to do it. In this book, Cay Horstmann, the principal author of the international best-selling Core Java™, offers a rapid, code-based introduction that’s completely practical. Horstmann introduces Scala concepts and techniques in “blog-sized” chunks that you can quickly master and apply. Hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert. 

## 13. Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model: Applications and Integration in Scala and Akka by Vaughn Vernon

### Description

Enterprise software development has been much more difficult and failure-prone than it needs to be. Now, veteran software engineer and author Vaughn Vernon offers an easier and more rewarding method to succeeding with Actor model. Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model shows how the reactive enterprise approach, Actor model, Scala, and Akka can help you overcome previous limits of performance and scalability, and skillfully address even the most challenging non-functional requirements.

## 14. Building a Recommendation Engine with Scala by Saleem Ansari
