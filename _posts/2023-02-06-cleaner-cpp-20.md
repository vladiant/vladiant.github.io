## Tips
* Use the Core Cpp Guidelines and tools that help you implement them.
* Use SOLID principles to guide design.
* Orgzanize headers to reduce coupling.
* Use modules for new projects.
* Consider using [std::expected](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected) for expected errors.
* Use generators for lazy evaluation and for inversion of dependencies.
* Avoid Primitive Obsession.
* Use interfaces on component boundaries.
* Inject implementation dependencies.
* Consider the use of Inversion of Control containers to construct objects.
* Prefer composition over implementation inheritance.
