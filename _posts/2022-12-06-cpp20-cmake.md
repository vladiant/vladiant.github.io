# Modern Cmake style
* Target centric
   * [target_compile_definitions](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_definitions.html)
   * [target_compile_features](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_features.html)
   * [target_compile_options](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html)
   * [target_include_directories](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html)
   * [target_link_directories](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_directories.html)
   * [target_link_libraries](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html)
   * [target_link_options](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_options.html)
   * [target_precompile_headers](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_precompile_headers.html)
   * [target_sources](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_sources.html)
   * [get_target_property](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/get_target_property.html)
   * [set_target_properties](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set_target_properties.html)
* Each target should fully describe how to use it
* Use `PRIVATE`, `INTERFACE`, `PUBLIC` keywords to specify the scope.

## Structure
* [add_library()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html)
* [add_executable()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html)
* [add_test()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_test.html)

## Flow
```sh
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## CLI
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/)
* [ccmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html)
* [cmake-gui](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-gui.1.html)

## Extensions
* [CPack](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.1.html?highlight=cpack#cpack)
* [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.1.html?highlight=cpack#ctest)
