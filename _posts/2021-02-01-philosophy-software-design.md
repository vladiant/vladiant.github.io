## Highlights
* [41:17](https://youtu.be/bmSAYlu0NcY?t=2476) "One summer, a couple of my graduate stduents went there for internships. They came back, and they just couldn't believe what they'd seen. And this was interesting because mu students had been whining for the whole previous year about why do we have to write unit tests and write documentation. Linux doesn't have any unit tests. And Linux doesn't have any comments. Why do we have to do this? I never heard that again after they came back from Facebook."
* [42:00](https://youtu.be/bmSAYlu0NcY?t=2519) ".. but Mark Zuckerberg is the fourth wealthiest person on the planet. How can this be a bad approach? And, of course, the answer is, you know, you can be successful with crappy code."

## My notes
* Minimize complexity.
* Classes should be deep in functionality compared to interface.
* Strategic programming beats tactical programming after 6 to 12 months.
* Define semantics to minimize and eliminate exceptions.
* Unit tests and documentation are a must!
* Culture attracts best programmers.
