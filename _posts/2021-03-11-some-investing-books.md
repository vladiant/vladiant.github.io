## Inside Volatility Arbitrage: The Secrets of Skewness by Daniel Arbuckle

### Description

Today's traders want to know when volatility is a sign that the sky is falling (and they should stay out of the market), and when it is a sign of a possible trading opportunity. Inside Volatility Arbitrage can help them do this. Author and financial expert Alireza Javaheri uses the classic approach to evaluating volatility -- time series and financial econometrics -- in a way that he believes is superior to methods presently used by market participants. He also suggests that there may be "skewness" trading opportunities that can be used to trade the markets more profitably. Filled with in-depth insight and expert advice, Inside Volatility Arbitrage will help traders discover when "skewness" may present valuable trading opportunities as well as why it can be so profitable.

"To paraphrase Mark Twain, there are three kinds of risks: volatility, volatility of volatility, and the standard error of volatility of volatility. This comprehensive volume applies these fundamental concepts in providing an inside peek into the fascinating world of volatility trading and other sophisticated strategies. As such, this book will appeal to anyone whose lives are touched by uncertainty in the financial markets." —Peter Carr, PhD, head of Quantitative Financial Research, Bloomberg LP Director of the Masters in Math Finance program, NYU "Understanding the volatility smile requires finding the appropriate model for stock evolution, fitting its parameters to observed option prices, and examining the consistency between implied evolution and true evolution. Alireza Javaheri's book tackles all of these issues, with an especially comprehensive treatment of parameter estimation." —Emanuel Derman, author of My Life as a Quant.
