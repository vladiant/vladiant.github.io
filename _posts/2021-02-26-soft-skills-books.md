Performance requires performance planning and ongoing reviews.
Psychologists Eve Ash and Peter Quarry designed this series of videos as a way to ‘reinvent appraisals’ so they are productive and appreciated by staff and managers. It is aimed at executives and managers at all levels, team leaders and employees - anyone who participates in the process of performance management will benefit from this series of five videos.
