## When writing libraries
* Avoid allocations if possible, request allocators or buffers from user
* Try and make your library freehosted. (No call of OS functions)

## Memory management
* Consider centralizing allocations
* Differentiate between temporary and long lived allocations
* Use buffers with maximum size where possible
* Consider handles instead of pointers (eg.ECS)
