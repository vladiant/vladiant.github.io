## 1. Mastering GitHub by Christophe Porteneuve

### Description

## 2. Functional Programming with Python by Christopher Armstrong

### Description

In this Functional Programming with Python training course, expert author Chris Armstrong will teach you functional programming techniques for making maintainable, modular, and testable code. This course is designed for users that already have experience with Python.

## 3. Object Oriented and Functional Programming by Richard Warburton

### Description

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has well established design principles, such as SOLID. For many developers, architecture and functional programming are at odds with each other: They do not know how their existing tricks of the trade convert into functional design. This problem becomes worse as hybrid languages such as Scala, Java 8, and Ruby become more and more common. This webcast reveals how functional programming can help viewers implement the SOLID design principles, as well as how a functional mindset is actually advantageous for achieving the holy grail of OOP: Encapsulation.

## 4. Functional Reactive Programming by Stephen Blackheath Anthony Jones

### Description

Functional Reactive Programming teaches you how FRP works and how to use it. You’ll begin by gaining an understanding of what FRP is and why it’s so powerful. Then, you’ll work through greenfield and legacy code as you learn to apply FRP to practical use cases. You’ll find examples in this book from many application domains using both Java and JavaScript. When you’re finished, you’ll be able to use the FRP approach in the systems you build and spend less time fixing problems.
