## A multi-photo session with different emotions

```
Using the original photo, create a 3x3 grid of photos: each frame with a different pose and a different facial expression, without repetitions.
```

## Color the sketch
```
Transform this sketch into a photorealistic anime-style scene, preserving the perspective and key compositional elements, but enhancing the textures, materials, and lighting.
```

## Banner with a quote
```
A wide banner with a quote from a famous person: brown background, light gold serif font. The quote reads, `If the rules are such that you can't make progress, then you have to fight the rules.`; and a smaller caption reads, `Elon Musk`. A large opening quotation mark with gradient transparency precedes the text. The author's portrait is on the left, the text on the right. The text takes up two-thirds of the image, the portrait one-third; the portrait has a subtle gradient transition.
```

## Colorize a black and white photo
```
Convert this black and white image to color.
```

## Selfies with cartoon characters
```
A vertical 9:16 fisheye selfie featuring an ultra-realistic girl (based on the attached photo) with [list, of, characters]. We're all smiling and making silly facial expressions. The scene takes place in a brightly lit, small, white living room. The camera is positioned high. Extreme fisheye distortion. Realistic, cinematic lighting of the cartoon characters is integrated with stylized realism.
```

## Exploded view of the object
```
Transform the image of [object name] into an exploded view. If files are attached, use them as references. The component parts of the object are neatly separated and held in space without falling or colliding with each other. The elements are arranged orderly: either along an imaginary axis or at equal distances around the center (depending on the shape of the original object). Every detail retains realistic materials, textures, and proportions, as in an engineering demonstration or museum rendering. The background is minimalist and artistic—a neutral space with a soft gradient and depth. Lighting emphasizes form and volume. Image format 16:9 (horizontal).
```

## Photos from the 90s
```
Transform your uploaded portrait(s) into a believable 1990s photo set in a Russian home. Replace the background with an authentic home interior: a room with old furniture and rugs on the wall; household items from that era on the table. The character(s) wear clothing typical of the 1990s—layered, loose-fitting, and vintage textures. Lighting—a sharp direct flash or a built-in hard flash with strong shadows for contrast; film-style imitation: grain, slight blurring at the edges, muted colors with individual bright accents. The atmosphere is nostalgic, like a photo from a family album from 1990–1996, with a softly degraded color palette and a distinctive film texture.
```

## Complete background replacement
```
Change the background of the character(s) in the image to the following: […].
```

## 2D pixel art
```
Convert to pixel art: retro 8-bit or 16-bit video game style, clearly visible pixel grid, reduced resolution with a "square," blocky shape, simplified color palette, arcade-style aesthetic. Preserve the key features of the object despite the pixelation.
```

## Minecraft-style image (with voxel cubes)
```
Transform the original photo into an isometric 3D scene in the style of Minecraft voxel art. Preserve the original composition, colors, poses, and key details. Everything should be assembled from small cubes under bright, neutral lighting. Crisp edges, subtle ambient occlusion, ultra-clear rendering, 8K. Negative prompts: photorealism, smooth gradients, curved surfaces, blur, watermarks, unnecessary text, multi-block facial fragmentation.
```

## A diagram in the style of a scientific drawing
```
Create a realistic close-up photograph of [object name]. If files are attached, use them as references. Add a graphic layer on top of the image that resembles a technical sketch: translucent lines, contours, and explanatory elements, as if the object were being analyzed by engineers on-site. Some sections of the body are visually "opened" (transparent), allowing one to see the internal structure and design logic. Measurement lines, load directions, and symbols are carefully integrated into the composition. A caption with the object's name is included in one corner. The overall style is a combination of photorealism, precision, and educational clarity: high detail, natural colors, ultra-sharp focus, and the feel of professional documentary photography with overlaying analytical graphics. Image format 16:9 (horizontal).
```

## Try on clothes
```
Combine source images (represented by multiple source files or a collage in a single file) into a single composition. Keep all key objects recognizable and preserve their proportions and details. Blend images naturally, with consistent lighting, shadows, perspective, and style. Photorealistic, high-resolution, seamless integration.
```

## Restoration of old photographs
```
Restore this vintage photo, sharpen details, and bring natural tones to skin, clothing, and background lighting.
```

## Removing objects from a photo
```
Remove [object name(s)] from the scene.
```

## Isometric diagram by hand
```
Create an isometric map of [this street] in a hand-drawn style. Add captions in English.
```

## Complete the image
```
Restore missing image areas (with [checkerboard/white/solid] fill) and return a logically complete image.
```

## Overlay a photo on a dodecahedron
```
Place this image on the dodecahedron.
```
