## Necessities
* Software works and does not fail
* Gets it right the first time
* Extensive testing
* Regulatory audits

## Challenges
* Speed of Innovation
* Trustworthy Technology Selection
* Strict Development Process
* Long Release Timelines
* Formal Documentation

## Questions to ask yourself:
* Are you writing safety-critical code?
* Does my code follow clear and infallible logic?
* Will my colleagues understand my code?
* Will someone else understand my code in ten years?
* Will I understand my code in ten years?
* Are assumptions and key context documented?
* Is my code consistent with our documented standards?
* Does my code fail safely and gracefully?
* Is my code defensible (logs and stacktraces)?
* Did I introduce new [SOUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_of_unknown_pedigree)?
* Do my tests cover each part of my code?
