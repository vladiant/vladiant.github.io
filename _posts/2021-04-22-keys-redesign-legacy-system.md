## Key Ingredients
* Have a definite measure of success
* Team composition: Historical system knowledge, Design Architectural Experience, Creativity
* Business / Market Buy In

## Key to Requirements
* Analyze the data flows through the current system - peak loads, long latencies, input composition
* Biggest volumes of transactions probably simplest to replace, low hanging fruit

## Key to Design
* Produce a design first and plug implementation technologies in later
* Underlying technology replacement is usually not the answer
* Avoid mimicking legacy design with new tehcnologies i.e. a port

## Key to Charting Progress
* Project must be staged via deliverables/milestones/tasks
* Deliverable - measurable and tangible outcome of the project
* Milestones identify when one or multiple groups of activities have been completed
* Tasks are small packets of work to achieve the above - Attainable, Observable, Chartable
* Attainable/Realistic with Observable objects
* Keep short task timeframes

## Key to Moving Forwards
* Iterative/Adaptive improvements
* Quality is the result of consistent incremental improvement
* Struggle to adhere to design goals and vision, Remember real world is messy
* If current design has a terminal mismatch with reality, be flexible, evolve the design

## Key to Delivering Product
* Iteration is the key
* Identifying and shortening the Feedback loop(s) is critical to successful on time delivery.

## Key to Understanding/Confidence System Health
 * Meaningful metrics, watermark alarms
 * Four golden metrics: Latency, Traffic / Throughput, Saturation, Errors

## Key to a Successful Rollout
* Move user by functionality not by entity
* Pull large multi-method clients over sooner; see larger benefits realized
