## 2. Multiplexed Networks for Embedded Systems: CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Safe-by-Wire...by Dominique Paret

### Description

Multiplexed networks are essential for the unified, efficient and cost-effective exchange of electronic information within embedded component systems. This is especially important in automotive manufacturing as vehicles become increasingly reliant on robust electronic networks and systems for improved reliability, anti-lock brake systems (ABS), steering, on-board navigation systems, and much more. The latest systems such as X-by-Wire and FlexRay aim to produce faster, fault-tolerant network component interconnects, for state-of-the-art network implementation and safer, more reliable engineering of vehicular systems.

This book provides a thorough and comprehensive introduction to automotive multiplexed network buses, covering the technical principles, components, implementation issues and applications.

## 3. Automotive SPICE in Practice by Joerg Zimmer, Lars Dittmann, Markus Mueller, Klaus Hoermann

### Description

Automotive SPICE is a framework for designing and assessing software development processes. It has been derived from the ISO/IEC 15504 standard, also known as SPICE, and has been developed under the Automotive SPICE initiative by the consensus of several major car manufacturers such as Audi, BMW, Ford, Fiat, Daimler, Porsche, Volkswagen, and Volvo. Today, Automotive SPICE has become a standard in the international automotive industry.
This book is written as a guide to help the reader understand and interpret the requirements of this standard and to implement Automotive SPICE in a real world application environment. It is written for engineers, practitioners, managers, and project managers who need practical guidance in applying or implementing the Automotive SPICE framework in their company, and for any assessor looking for clear, consistent, and constructive rating guidelines. Important topics, such as traceability, functional safety (IEC 61508), and the relationship between Automotive SPICE and CMMI are given particular attention.

## 4. The Car Hacker's Handbook by Craig Smith

### Description

The Car Hacker's Handbook shows how to identify vulnerabilities in modern automotive vehicles.

## 5. Embedded Software by Colin Walls

### Description

As the embedded world expands, developers must have a strong grasp of many complex topics in order to make faster, more efficient and more powerful microprocessors to meet the public’s growing demand. Embedded Software: The Works covers all the key subjects embedded engineers need to understand in order to succeed, including Design and Development, Programming, Languages including C/C++, and UML, Real Time Operating Systems Considerations, Networking, and much more. New material on Linux, Android, and multi-core gives engineers the up-to-date practical know-how they need in order to succeed.

Colin Walls draws upon his experience and insights from working in the industry, and covers the complete cycle of embedded software development: its design, development, management, debugging procedures, licensing, and reuse. For those new to the field, or for experienced engineers looking to expand their skills, Walls provides the reader with detailed tips and techniques, and rigorous explanations of technologies.

## 7. Embedded Linux Systems with the Yocto Project™ by Rudolf J. Streif

### Description

Developers are increasingly integrating Linux into their embedded systems: It supports virtually all hardware architectures and many peripherals, scales well, offers full source code, and requires no royalties. The Yocto Project makes it much easier to customize Linux for embedded systems. If you’re a developer with working knowledge of Linux, Embedded Linux Systems with the Yocto Project™ will help you make the most of it.

## 8. Innovative Research in Attention Modeling and Computer Vision Applications by Rajarshi Pal

### Description

Robotics and autonomous systems can aid disabled individuals in daily living or make a workplace more productive, but these tools are only as effective as the technology behind them. Robotic systems must be able to accurately identify and act upon elements in their environment to be effective in performing their duties. Innovative Research in Attention Modeling and Computer Vision Applications explores the latest research in image processing and pattern recognition for use in robotic real-time cryptography and surveillance applications. This book provides researchers, students, academicians, software designers, and application developers with next-generation insight into the use of computer vision technologies in a variety of industries and endeavors. This premier reference work includes chapters on topics ranging from biometric and facial recognition technologies, to digital image and video watermarking, among many others.

## 9. Learning Apache Thrift by Krzysztof Rakowski

### Description

This book will help you set aside the basics of service-oriented systems through your first Apache Thrift-powered app. Then, progressing to more complex examples, it will provide you with tips for running large-scale applications in production environments.

You will learn how to assess when Apache Thrift is the best tool to be used. To start with, you will run a simple example application, learning the framework's structure along the way; you will quickly advance to more complex systems that will help you solve various real-life problems. Moreover, you will be able to add a communication layer to every application written in one of the popular programming languages, with support for various data types and error handling. Further, you will learn how pre-eminent companies use Apache Thrift in their popular applications.

This book is a great starting point if you want to use one of the best tools available to develop cross-language applications in service-oriented architectures.

## 10. Vehicular Networking by Falko Dressler, Christoph Sommer
