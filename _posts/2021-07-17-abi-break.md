## ABI

It is how the objects and types look to the compiler.
* Size, number and order of data members in a type.
* Size, number and order of virtual functions.
* Number and order of function parameters
* Function return types

## Changing the return type
* <https://godbolt.org/z/5e8K8h9GM>
* Return type is not part of the name mangling, so if the header doesn't match the binary things can go very wrong.

## Changing the order of virtual functions
* <https://godbolt.org/z/PbGfn8df4>
* If you change the order of virtual functions the compiler will call the wrong one!

## Changing the order of member variables
* <https://godbolt.org/z/dW8YocG1Y>
* Just like chnaging function order, the compiler would generate the wrong offset

## Broken ABI
* Same words, different meaning

## ABI stability advantages
* To prevent ABI brekage bugs, our compiler and standard library vendors have been giving us "ABI stability" from some time now.
* This is good in some ways
* A new C++ executable on OS with new compiler with knowledge that libraries built with old compiler will work.

## ABI stability stuck
* Can never change the return type of the function
* Can never add/remove/reorder virtual functions
* Can never add/remove/reorder member variables
* Can never add/remove/reorder function parameters (but new overloads can be added)

## ABI stability disadvantages
* Bug requires changing layout - cannot be fixed
* Cannot add/remove member variable
* Cannot change design
* [The Day The Standard Library Died](https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/abi/)
* [Microsoft C/C++ language conformance by Visual Studio version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/visual-cpp-language-conformance?view=msvc-160)

## Conclusions
* By refusing to break the ABI we are encouraging and enabling companies to use old, broken, insecure and unfixable code that was compiled with a buggy compiler!
* This only helps enforce the idea that C++ is an unsecure language!
* A silent ABI break is very dangerous, so this must be detectable at compile, link, or runtime
* Possible Solution: Provide a C wrapper
