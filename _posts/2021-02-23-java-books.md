## Intro from 2017

Continuous education is the same or even more important thing for developer than continuous integration. Any serious developer should read at least one book every half a year if he wants to survive in industry. As it was said in Alice in Wonderland: "Here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.”

## 7. Mastering Apache Maven 3 by Prabath Siriwardena

### Description

Maven is the number one build tool used by developers for more than a decade. Maven stands out among other build tools due to its extremely extensible architecture, which is built on top of the concept "convention over configuration". This has made Maven the de-facto tool used to manage and build Java projects.

This book is a technical guide to the difficult and complex concepts in Maven and build automation. It starts with the core Maven concepts and its architecture, and then explains how to build extensions such as plugins, archetypes, and lifecycles in depth.

This book is a step-by-step guide that shows you how to use Apache Maven in an optimal way to address your enterprise build requirements.

## 8. Spring Data by Petri Kainulainen

### Description

Spring Framework has always had a good support for different data access technologies. However, developers had to use technology-specific APIs, which often led to a situation where a lot of boilerplate code had to be written in order to implement even the simplest operations. Spring Data changed all this. Spring Data makes it easier to implement Spring-powered applications that use cloud-based storage services, NoSQL databases, map-reduce frameworks or relational databases.
This book provides a brief introduction to the underlying data storage technologies, gives step-by-step instructions that will help you utilize the discussed technologies in your applications, and provides a solid foundation for expanding your knowledge beyond the concepts described in this book.
