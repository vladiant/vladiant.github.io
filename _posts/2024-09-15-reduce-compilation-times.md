## Build system
* `cmake -G Ninja`

## Linkers
* `lld` much faster than the default linker `ld` or `gold`
* `-fuse-ld=lld`
* `mold` is even faster than `lld`

## Compiler Caching
* `CCache`
* `ln -s ccache /usr/local/bin/g++`

## Open Source Tooling
* clang `-ftime-trace` flag creates a flame chart JSON file of each translation unit
* Open tracing output with `chrome://tracing`
* `ClangBuildAnalyzer` parses and summarizes these files
* GCC `-ftime-report` makes the compiler print some statistics to stderr about the time consumed by each pass when it finishes.

## Techniques
* Forward Declarations - `<iosfwd>`, dedicated headers with forward declarations
* Removing unused includes - `https://include-what-you-use.org/`, Graphviz
* Splitting Protocol and Implementation - Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering, PIMPL
* Object Libraries
* Precompiled Headers - since CMake 3.16, headers that are often included bu not changed often, use profiling to determine headers to pre-compile
* Unity Build - since CMake 3.16

## Main Takeaways
* Profile your build to determine where to focus your effort
* Forward declarations
* Remove unused includes
* Split Protocol from Implementation
* Merge executables
* Tune precompiled headers
* Unity build and reducing number of files
